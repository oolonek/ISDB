{"name":"ISDB","tagline":"A database of In-Silico predicted MS/MS spectrum of Natural Products","body":"### Welcome to ISDB GitHub Page.\r\nHere you will find the full _In-Silico_ Database (ISDB) described in the paper \"Integration of Molecular Networking and In-Silico MS/MS Fragmentation for Natural Products Dereplication\". This ISDB contains predicted MS/MS fragmentation spectrum in positive ion mode for 170 602 Natural Products (NPs). \r\n\r\n### How to use the ISDB.\r\nInstructions for using this ISDB in a dereplication workflow are available as Supporting Information of the original publication here : \r\n\r\n\r\n### Links.\r\nThe GNPS (Global Natural Products Social molecular networking) platform is accessible here : [GNPS](http://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-splash.jsp)\r\nThe Tremolo tool used for the spectral matching against the ISDB is included inside the ISDB zip file. It's documentation is available here : [Tremolo](http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/Software/Tremolo/#Documentation) \r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
